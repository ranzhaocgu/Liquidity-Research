\begin{abstract}
We consider a dynamic market model where buyers and sellers submit limit
orders. If at a given moment in time, the buyer is unable to complete his
entire order due to the shortage of sell orders at the required limit price,
the unmatched part of the order is recorded in the order book. Subsequently
these buy unmatched orders may be matched with new incoming sell orders. The
resulting demand curve constitutes the sole input to our model. The clearing
price is then mechanically calculated using the market clearing condition.
It depends on the position of the large trader. We assume a continuous model
for the demand curve. We show that generically there exists an equivalent
martingale measure for the clearing price, for all possible strategies of
the large trader, if the driving noise is a Brownian sheet, while there may
not be if the driving noise is multidimensional Brownian motion.

Another contribution of this paper is to prove that, if there exists such an
equivalent martingale measure, then, under mild conditions, there is no
arbitrage. We use the Ito-Wentzell formula to obtain both results. We also
characterize the dynamics of the demand curve and of the clearing price in
the equivalent martingale measure. We find that the volatility of the
clearing price is inversely proportional to the sum of buy and sell order
flow density (evaluated at the clearing price), which confirms the intuition
that volatility is inversely proportional to volume. We also demonstrate
that our approach is implementable. We use real order book data and simulate
option prices under a particularly simple parameterization of our model.

The no-arbitrage conditions we obtain are applicable to a wide class of
models, in the same way that the Heath-Jarrow-Morton conditions apply to a
wide class of interest rate models.

\section{Introduction}

Most liquidity models in mathematical finance abstract the trading mechanism
from the characterization of prices in the resulting market. Our viewpoint
is here fundamentally different. In our model, equilibrium prices of assets
are completely determined by the order flow, which is viewed as an exogenous
process. We model a market of assets without specialist where every trader
submits limit orders, that is, for a buy order, the buyer specifies the
maximum price, or buy limit price, that he/she is willing to pay, and, for a
sell order, the seller specifies the minimum price, or sell limit price, at
which he/she is willing to sell \footnote{%
There is no loss of generality in that statement. A buy market order can be
specified in our model as a buy limit order with limit price equal to
infinity. Since we model assets with only positive prices, a sell market
order can be specified in our model as a sell limit order with a limit price
equal to zero.}.

If at a given moment in time, the buyer is unable to complete his entire
order due to the shortage of sell orders at the required limit price, the
unmatched part of the order is recorded in the order book.A symmetric
outcome exists in the case of incoming sell orders. Subsequently these buy
unmatched orders may be matched with new incoming sell orders. We note that
many electronic exchanges, such as NYSE\ ARCA, operate like this.
Time-priority is used to break indeterminacies of a match between an
incoming buyer at limit price superior to the ask price, i.e., the lowest
limit price in the sell order book. As a result, the equilibrium of \textit{%
clearing price} process is always defined.

Since the matching mechanism does not add any information to the economy,
all information about asset prices is included in the order flow. Whether
public exchanges should or should not reveal in real-time the data contained
in the order book is an important issue, which continues to preoccupy the
financial markets community \cite{WW02}. Our theoretical framework
accommodates either viewpoint, but our empirical application is better
tailored to the viewpoint that order books are public information, but that
the large trader position is not known. The current blossoming of
high-frequency trading activity \cite{BRZ,BLT06,Eng00,Hau08} seems to
confirm our viewpoint that traders are (i) interested in understanding order
book information, and (ii) trade on that information.

We do not address in this paper the issue of differential information
further. The market microstructure literature (such as \cite{Kyl85}, and all
following models) considers various models of trading involving uninformed
traders, called noise traders, and one, or several informed traders. One of
the key results of the Kyle model is that, given the information available
to noise traders, the resulting price process is a martingale in the
appropriate measure, whereas it may not be for the informed traders. As a
consequence we do not believe that abstracting issues of differential
information is limiting. The order books reflect all the public information.
Public information corresponds to the filtration under which the clearing
price needs to have an equivalent martingale measure, in order to avoid
arbitrage. Obviously, the clearing price may not be a martingale in the
aforementioned measure if the filtration is enlarged to include private
information.

There are roughly two different classes of models in the liquidity
literature. The first class of models (\cite{BB04,BK15a, BK15b,Fre98, Jar92,
Jar94, PS98a, PS98b, RS10, SW00}) considers the action of a large trader who
can manipulate the prices in the market. There are mainly two different
types of strategies a large trader can employ to that effect. The first one
is to corner the market, and then squeeze the shorts.\ The second one is to
"front-run one's own trades". While some exchanges have rules to curtail the
cornering of the market, front-running seems more difficult to ban from an
exchange. It is known in discrete-time trading, that, if there is no
possibility of arbitrage in periods where the large investor does not trade,
then there is no market manipulation strategy.

The second class of models (\cite{CR07, CJP04, CST10,GS11}) abstracts the
issues of market manipulation away, and considers all traders as
price-takers. In particular, \cite{CJP04} introduced an exogenous residual
supply curve against which an investor trades. The investor trades market
orders, and his/her order is matched instantaneously. As a consequence of
the instantaneity, it is plausible for \cite{CJP04} to assume the "price
effect of an order is limited to the very moment when the order is placed in
the market" (dixit \cite{BB04}), so that that the residual supply curve at a
future time is statistically independent from the order just matched. For us
however, this assumption is not convenient, since it does not explain how
prices can incorporate information from the arrival of new orders. The paper
by Roch \cite{RA11} bridges a gap between these two classes of models, and
allows for a linear impact of the large trader quantity on the demand price.

Our model belongs to the first class of models. An important difference is
that we define our demand curve as quantity as a function of price, unlike
most other authors, who define it as price as a function of quantity.
Indeed, for our technical apparatus and our simulations to work, we found it
necessary to have either compact support for the quantities or compact
support for the price. Since the domain of variation of prices is better
understood empirically, we decided to have compact support for the prices,
which compelled us to model demand as a function of price.

We proceed in two steps to define our model. In the first step, we consider
a market with atomistic traders and a large trader, and develop conditions
on the net demand curve of the atomistic traders such that the large trader
cannot manipulate the market. Since the large trader cannot manipulate the
market, he will refrain from trading large orders, which would generate
liquidity costs. Thus, the large trader is reduced to trading like an
atomistic trader. Thus, in the second step, we assume that all traders are
atomistic and trade in such a way that no market manipulation is possible.
We then use our no-arbitrage model to price options. We point out a
difference between our model and the Bank and Baum (hereafter BB04) model:
we do not need to consider all possible strategies of the large trader to
calculate an option price, since these strategies are implicit in the model.
This is an expedient feature of our model:\ we do not need to identify
whether there is a large trader, or several large traders on the market for
the option pricing formula to be plausible. We leave for future work the
rigorous development of a second fundamental theorem of asset pricing,

In our model all the information is contained in a Brownian sheet, which
drives the dynamics of the market net demand curve. Such a string model has
already been introduced in finance to model the yield curve. Santa Clara and
Sornette \cite{SCS01} argue that a "discontinuous [with respect to term]
forward curve [..] is intuitively unlikely". We also believe that in a first
step of modelling one should model demand curves as continuous in price.
More importantly, a string model allows us to use the Ito-Wentzell formula,
unlike, as for as our limited experience shows, a model with a large number
of Brownian motions. We remind the reader that a string model allows to
model any correlation structure in the net demand curve.

Our contributions are two-fold. First, we show that under a set of
assumptions the large trader cannot generate arbitrage. Second, we develop a
specific model that satisfies all the assumptions, and demonstrate that it
is is implementable. As in the early days of the Heath-Jarrow-Morton
methodology, we use only historical estimation (in our case, of the order
book)\ to fit our model and solve for the market price of risk. We expect
that, should this paper meet with interest around practitioners,
market-implied implementations will see the day. Unsurprisingly, we obtain a
smile curve for implied volatility. We note that this particular feature is
not a very strong sign of the adequacy of our approach to model asset
prices, as most models that came after Black-Scholes \cite{BS73} result in a
smile curve for implied volatility. Although limited, our results are
however encouraging. They show that a fairly demanding theoretical model can
be easily implemented.

The structure of the paper is as follows. Section \ref{sec::pre} covers
preliminaries on the market mechanism and string model. In section 3 we
introduce our general model, show general conditions under which there is no
arbitrage; we then develop a simple version of this model, which satisfies
all the conditions. Empirical analysis in done in section 4, where we
describe our data set, the discetized algorithm, as well as the pricing of
options.

\section{Preliminaries}

\label{sec::pre}

\subsection{The Market Mechanism}

\noindent A buy\ limit order specifies how many shares a trader wants to
buy, and at what maximum price he is willing to buy them. We call this price
the (buy) \textit{limit price}. A buy\ limit order specifies how many shares
a trader wants to buy, and at what maximum price he is willing to buy them.
We call this price the (sell)\ \textit{limit price}. The unmatched buy and
sell orders are stored in order books, until they are either cancelled or
matched with an incoming order. An incoming order is matched with the order
in the opposite side of the market which has the best price. The clearing
price of the transaction is equal to the limit price of the order in the
book, and not of the incoming order. Partial execution is allowed, and, ties
are resolved by time-priority. We give herafter an example of the matching
mechanism in discrete time, i.e., at most one order arrives at time $t\in
\{0,1,2,..\}.$

%\textbf{Example}

\begin{example}
Suppose that the clearing price at time $0$ is any price $P(0)\in \lbrack
100,120]$. After clearing, that is, when $0<t<1$ we suppose that the order
books contain the following orders

\begin{equation*}
\begin{tabular}{|l|l|}
\hline
\multicolumn{2}{|l|}{Buy Order Book} \\
Price & Quantity \\ \hline\hline
100 & 10 \\ \hline
\end{tabular}%
\text{ \ \ \ \ \ }%
\begin{tabular}{|l|l|}
\hline
\multicolumn{2}{|l|}{Sell Order Book} \\
Price & Quantity \\ \hline\hline
120 & 10 \\ \hline
130 & 10 \\ \hline
\end{tabular}%
\end{equation*}

At time $t=1$ a buy order arrives with a limit price of \$125, and a
quantity of 15. The exchange matches it with the best sell order, i.e., the
one with a sell limit price of \$120. However, execution is only partial,
and the remainder of the buy order is placed in the order book at the limit
price of \$120, resulting in the following order books:

\begin{equation*}
\begin{tabular}{|l|l|}
\hline
\multicolumn{2}{|l|}{Buy Order Book} \\
Price & Quantity \\ \hline\hline
100 & 10 \\ \hline
125 & 5 \\ \hline
\end{tabular}%
\text{ \ \ \ \ \ }%
\begin{tabular}{|l|l|}
\hline
\multicolumn{2}{|l|}{Sell Order Book} \\
Price & Quantity \\ \hline\hline
130 & 10 \\ \hline
\end{tabular}%
\end{equation*}

The clearing price at time 1 is equal to the limit price of the sell order,
i.e.:

\begin{equation*}
P(1)=120
\end{equation*}

$\blacksquare $

\end{example}

This example illustrates several properties of limit order markets. First,
the clearing price is always defined, and can assume any positive value%
\footnote{%
We do not consider markets for swaps, where the price can be negative.}.

Second, it is not inconceivable that an incoming order "crosses" the order
book, i.e., for the case of a buy order, that its limit price is higher than
the best sell order limit price (i.e, the best ask), since the buyer does
not lose a cent. Crossing the book is indeed advantageous for two reasons:
first, it allows for faster execution. In our example, had the buyer
submitted an order at price \$130 he would have bought the complete quantity
of shares (15)\ that he desired, rather than waiting an indeterminate amount
of time until enough sell orders arrive at his limit price. Second, suppose
that several buy orders are submitted at the same time. In case the demand
exceeds the supply at the best ask, the buy orders with the highest limit
price are executed first. Our own data analysis shows that few orders cross
the Arca book. This is consistent with the theory of optimal order book
placement suggested by Rosu \cite{Ros09}.

\bigskip

\subsection{String Modeling}

We now move to continuous-time. Be aware that we do not prove convergence of
a discrete-time model to our continuous-time model. We take the latter as a
given, plausible model of the market. We start with a filtered probability
space $(\Omega ,\mathcal{F},\{\mathcal{F}_{t}\},\mathbb{P})$ satisfying the
usual conditions. Equalities of random variables are to be understood almost
surely unless stated otherwise.

All the uncertainty is described by a one-dimensional Brownian sheet $W(s,t)$
which generates $\{\mathcal{F}_{t}\}$.There are several approaches to
construct a Brownian sheet, or, more generally stochastic partial
differential equations. According to Mueller \cite{Mue09} "One can use
either Walsh's \cite{Wal86} approach [..], the Hilbert space approach of Da
Prato and Zabczyk \cite{DPZ92}, or Krylov's \cite{Kry09} $L_{p}$ theory".
\cite{DPZ92} and \cite{Mue09} note that the Hilbert space approach is at
least as general as Walsh's approach. We use a combination of the Hilbert
space approach as exposed in \cite{CT06}, and Krylov's approach. We note
that in Walsh's approach the definitions (\ref{nonconvergent}) and (\ref%
{Forkrylov}) do not involve infinite series, but for our purpose the
approaches are equivalent.

\bigskip

We wish to make sense of the Brownian sheet and of its stochastic integral:%
\begin{equation}
I_{t}=\int_{u=0}^{t}\int_{s=0}^{S}b(s,u)W(ds,du)  \label{continuous}
\end{equation}%
\bigskip

where $W$ is a Brownian sheet and, for each $s\in \lbrack 0,S]$ the $%
\mathcal{F}_{t}-$adapted stochastic processes $b(s,t)$ satisfy:%
\begin{equation*}
\int_{s=0}^{S}b^{2}(s,t)ds=1
\end{equation*}

We first define $W_{t}$ as a random variable on the space $E\equiv
L^{2}[0,S] $ such that $W=\{W_{t}$;$t\in \lbrack 0,T]\}$ is an $E-$ valued
Wiener process. If we let $\{e_{n}^{\ast };n\geq 1\}$ be a complete
orthonormal basis of the dual $H^{\ast }$of the reproducing kernel Hilbert
space $H$ of $E$ and define:%
\begin{equation*}
w_{n}(t)=e_{n}^{\ast }(W_{t})
\end{equation*}

we have:%
\begin{equation}
W_{t}=\sum_{n=1}^{\infty }w_{n}(t)e_{n}  \label{nonconvergent}
\end{equation}

where $w_{n}$ are independent $\mathbb{R}$-valued standard Wiener processes.
While the series (\ref{nonconvergent})\ is not convergent in $E$ in $l^{2}$,
we can define the following integral (see \cite{DPZ92} p. 100)

\begin{equation*}
W(s,t)=\sum_{n=1}^{\infty }w_{n}(t)\int_{\alpha=0}^{s}e_{n}(\alpha )d\alpha
\text{ \ \ }s\in \lbrack 0,S]
\end{equation*}

which is our Brownian sheet. We now define a family of operators $B_{t}$:$%
E\rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ for $t\in \lbrack 0,T]$ by the formula:

\begin{equation*}
B_{t}f=\int_{s=0}^{S}b(s,t)f(s)ds
\end{equation*}

Note that $B$ is a Hilbert-Schmidt operator. We can also write this
expression as:

\begin{equation*}
B_{t}f=\sum_{n=1}^{\infty }b^{n}(t)e_{n}^{\ast }(f)
\end{equation*}

for some real-valued $\mathcal{F}_{t}-$adapted stochastic processes $b^{n}$
satisfying:

\begin{equation*}
b^{n}(t)=e_{n}^{\ast }(b(.,t))
\end{equation*}

Thus, we have the definition:

\begin{equation}
I_{t}=\int_{u=0}^{t}\sum_{n=1}^{\infty }b^{n}(u)dw_{n}(u)  \label{Forkrylov}
\end{equation}

We will use expression (\ref{continuous})\ for most of the text since it
will be convenient to see $b(s,u)W(ds,du)$ as being indexed by the continuum
$s\in \lbrack 0,S]$. However expression (\ref{Forkrylov})\ is\ an equally
valid expression. We now introduce a weaker version of Krylov's \cite{Kry09}
Theorem 3.1. (the Ito-Wentzell formula), with the continuous notation.
Whereas BB04 used Kunita's \cite{Kun97} version of the Ito-Wentzell formula,
we found Krylov's version to be slightly easier to check, since it is
directly developed with the Brownian sheet in mind. For the reader more
familiar with Kunita's version, we note that, in a string model like ours,
it is almost immediate to prove that the quadratic variation is twice
continuously differentiable.

\bigskip

Let $F:[0,S]\times \lbrack 0,T]\times \Omega \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ be a $%
\mathcal{F}_{t}$- adapted semimartingale, which we will write $F(x,t)$. Let $%
x:[0,T]\times \Omega \rightarrow \lbrack 0,S]$ be another $\mathcal{F}_{t}$-
adapted semimartingale.

\begin{eqnarray}
dF(x,t,\omega ) &=&\mu _{F}(x,t,\omega )dt+\sigma _{F}(x,t,\omega
)\int_{s=0}^{S}b_{F}(x,s,t,\omega )W(ds,dt,\omega )  \label{dQ} \\
dx(t,\omega ) &=&\mu _{x}(t,\omega )dt+\sigma _{x}(t,\omega
)\int_{s=0}^{S}b_{x}(s,t,\omega )W(ds,dt,\omega )  \notag
\end{eqnarray}

with:%
\begin{eqnarray*}
\int_{s=0}^{S}b_{F}^{2}(x,s,t,\omega )ds &=&1\text{ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ }0\leq
x\leq S \\
\int_{s=0}^{S}b_{x}^{2}(s,t,\omega )ds &=&1
\end{eqnarray*}

and such that the sclar products of $b_{F}(p)$ and $b_{x}$ are between $-1$
and $1$.

\subsection{Ito-Wentzell-Krylov Theorem}

We say that $(F,\mu _{F},\sigma _{F},b_{F},x,\mu _{x},\sigma _{x},b_{x})$
satisfy the Ito-Wentzell-Krylov condition (hereafter \textit{condition IWK})
if:

i) For each $x$ the restriction of the function $F_{t}(x)$ to $\omega \times
(0,T]$ is $\mathcal{F}_{T}$-measurable and $F_{0}(x)$ is $\mathcal{F}_{0}$%
-measurable;

ii) For any $\omega \in \Omega $ and $t\in \lbrack 0,T]$, the function\ $%
F(x,t)$ is continuous in $x$

iii) For almost any $(\omega ,t)\in \Omega \times \lbrack 0,T]$

\qquad a)$\mu _{F}(x)$ and $\sigma _{F}(x)b_{F}(x,s)$ and $\sigma
_{F}^{2}(x) $ are continuous in $x$

\qquad b)the following terms are continuous functions of $x$:

\qquad \qquad 1) $\frac{1}{2}\sigma _{x}^{2}(t)\frac{\partial ^{2}F(x,t)}{%
\partial x^{2}}+\mu _{x}(t)\frac{\partial F(x,t)}{\partial x}$

\qquad \qquad 2) $\sigma _{x}(t)b_{x}(s,t)\frac{\partial F(x,t)}{\partial x}$

\qquad \qquad 3) $\sigma _{x}(t)b_{x}(s,t)\frac{\partial (\sigma
_{F}(x,t)b_{F}(x,s,t))}{\partial x}$

\qquad \qquad 4) $\sigma _{x}(t)^{2}(\frac{\partial F(x,t)}{\partial x})^{2}$

\qquad \qquad 5) $\sigma _{x}^{2}(t)\int_{0}^{S}(b_{x}(s,t)\frac{\partial
(\sigma _{F}(x,t)b_{F}(x,s,t)}{\partial x})^{2}ds$

iv)\ For all $x$ in the domain of definition of the first argument of $F$,
we have almost surely:%
\begin{equation*}
\int_{t=0}^{T}F(x,t)\left|\mu _{x}(t)+\frac{1}{2}\sigma _{x}^{2}(t)\right|+%
\frac{1}{2}F^{2}(x,t)\sigma _{x}^{2}(t)+\left|\mu _{F}(x,t)\right|+\sigma
_{F}^{2}(x,t)dt<\infty
\end{equation*}

and equation (\ref{dQ}) admits a solution almost surely.

v) We have almost surely:%
\begin{equation*}
\int_{x=0}^{S}\left[\int_{t=0}^{T}F(x,t)\left(|\mu _{x}(t)|+\frac{1}{2}%
\sigma _{x}^{2}(t)\right)dt\right] +\left[\frac{1}{2}\left(%
\int_{t=0}^{T}F^{2}(x,t)\sigma _{x}^{2}(t)dt\right)^{\frac{1}{2}}\right]%
dx<\infty \
\end{equation*}

\qquad and, for all $x$ in the domain of definition of the first argument of
$F$%
\begin{gather*}
\int_{t=0}^{T}|\mu _{x}(x,t)|+\left|\frac{1}{2}\sigma _{x}^{2}(t)\frac{%
\partial ^{2}F(x,t)}{\partial x^{2}}+\mu _{x}(t)\frac{\partial F(x,t)}{%
\partial x}\right|+\left( \sigma _{x}(t)\frac{\partial F(x,t)}{\partial x}%
\right) ^{2}+\sigma _{F}^{2}(x,t) \\
+\left[\int_{s=0}^{S}(\sigma_{x}(t)b_{x}(s,t))^{2}\left(\frac{\partial }{%
\partial x}\sigma _{F}(x,t)b_{F}(x,s,t)\right)^{2}ds\right]dt<\infty
\end{gather*}

%\textbf{Theorem} (Ito-Wentzell-Krylov)

\begin{theorem}[Ito-Wentzell-Krylov]
\footnote{%
This is a weaker version of theorem 3.1 in Krylov.}Under condition IWK, for
any $t\in \lbrack 0,T]$ with probability one:%
\begin{eqnarray}
dF(x(t),t) &=&\left( \mu _{F}(x(t),t)+\frac{1}{2}\sigma _{x}^{2}(t)\frac{%
\partial ^{2}F(x(t),t)}{\partial x^{2}}+\mu _{x}(t)\frac{\partial F(x(t),t)}{%
\partial x}\right) dt  \label{ItoWentzell} \\
&&+\int_{s=0}^{S}\sigma _{x}(t)b_{x}(s,t)\frac{\partial (\sigma
_{F}(x(t),t)b_{F}(x(t),s,t))}{\partial x}dsdt  \notag \\
&&+\int_{s=0}^{S}\sigma _{F}(x(t),t)b_{F}(x(t),s,t)+\sigma _{x}(t)b_{x}(s,t)%
\frac{\partial F(x(t),t)}{\partial x}W(ds,dt)  \notag
\end{eqnarray}
\end{theorem}

\section{A Market with Atomistic Traders and a Large Trader}

%\textbf{Assumption 1 }

\begin{assumption}
\label{ass::market_frictionless} (Assumption A1 in\textbf{\ }\cite{Jar92}).\
The market is frictionless.
\end{assumption}

%\bigskip

%\textbf{Assumption 2 }

\begin{assumption}
Buy and sell limit prices can assume any real value between $0$ and $S$.
Orders can be submitted to the market at any time $t\in \mathbb{[\tau },T]$
with $\tau $ the time of beginning of trading. For convenience $\tau <0<T$,
where $t=0$ is present time.
\end{assumption}

%\bigskip

%\textbf{Notation}

\begin{notation}
Buy and sell limit prices are usually denoted by $p$.
\end{notation}

%\bigskip

%\textbf{Definitions: }

\begin{definition}
The net demand curve $Q$ is a function $[0,S]\times \mathbb{[\tau },T]\times
\Omega \mathbb{\rightarrow R}$ which value $Q(p,t,\omega )$\ is equal to the
difference between the (total) quantity of shares \textbf{submitted} for
purchase (at price lower than or equal to $p$) and the (total) quantity of
shares \textbf{submitted} for sale (at price larger than or equal to $p$)
between time zero and time $t$ by atomistic traders.
\end{definition}

%\bigskip

%\textbf{Remark 1: }

\begin{remark}
We do not define precisely what we mean by atomistic traders. We view them
as a continuum of traders. Each of them submits an infinitesimally small
order at a price $p$, such that there is no concentration of orders at any
particular price, as we formulate more clearly below, in contradistinction
with the large trader.
\end{remark}

%\bigskip

%\textbf{Remark 2:}

\begin{remark}
Obviously when the order quantity is unity for every order, the (total)
quantity of shares submitted for purchase is equal to the (total) number of
buy orders. The term \textquotedblleft total \textquotedblright refers to
the fact that we accumulate buy order quantities that arrived to the
exchange since the \textquotedblleft beginning of trading
\textquotedblright\ time $\tau <0$ until a time $t\geq 0$. Henceforth, we
will not refer to the time of beginning of trading $\tau $. In numerical
implementations, different values of $\tau $ will result in different
parameters for the model.
\end{remark}

%\bigskip \bigskip

%\textbf{Remark 3:}

\begin{remark}
For a fixed price $p$ the total quantity of shares submitted for purchase
(or for sale)\ does not need to be increasing in time, as some orders may be
cancelled. Even in the absence of cancellation, the absolute value of net
demand does not need to be increasing in time. Suppose for instance that at
time $t_{1}$ and price $p_{1}$ the net demand is $Q(p_{1},t_{1})>0$, i.e.,
there are buy orders in the order books, but no sell order. Arrival of a
sell order wih quantity $\delta $, with $0<\delta <Q(p_{1},t_{1})$ at time $%
t_{1} + dt$ at a price equal to or less than $p_{1}$ results in a
modification of the net demand curve to $%
Q(p_{1}-dp,t_{1}+dt)=Q(p_{1},t_{1})-\delta $. In other terms orders matched
results in a decrease in the absolute value of the net demand curve.
\end{remark}

%\bigskip

%\textbf{Assumption 3: }

\begin{assumption}
\label{ass::decrease_net_demand} The net demand curve $Q$ is strictly
decreasing in its first argument, for all $p$ except $p=0$ and $p=S$.
\end{assumption}

%\bigskip

%\textbf{Remark 4:}

\begin{remark}
The fact that net demand curves are decreasing is an immediate consequence
of our market mechanism (see above), and the fact that order quantities are
by definition positive. Indeed, the number of shares of available buy orders
is decreasing in price, while the number of shares of available sell orders
is increasing. The net demand, being the difference of buy and sell orders,
is a decreasing function of price. Assumption~\ref{ass::decrease_net_demand}
is similar to Assumption A3 in \cite{Jar92} or Assumption 2 in \cite{BB04}.
\end{remark}

%\bigskip

%\textbf{Assumption 4 }

\begin{assumption}
\label{ass::demand_twice_diff} For each\textbf{\ }$t$ the net demand curve%
\textbf{\ }$Q$ is twice continuously differentiable in the first argument.
\end{assumption}

%\bigskip

%\textbf{Assumption 5:}\

\begin{assumption}
\label{ass::primtive_Q_para} The primitives (characteristics) of the model
are $\mathbb{R}$-valued $\mathcal{F}_{t}$-adapted processes coefficients $%
\mu _{Q}(p,.)$, $\sigma _{Q}(p,.)$ and $b_{Q}(p,s,.)$, and:

\begin{eqnarray}
dQ(p,t,\omega ) &=&\mu _{Q}(p,t,\omega )dt+\sigma _{Q}(p,t,\omega
)\int_{s=0}^{S}b_{Q}(p,s,t,\omega )W(ds,dt,\omega )\text{ \ \ \ }0\leq p\leq
S  \label{GenMod1} \\
Q(p,0) &=&Q_{0}(p)>0\qquad \text{\ }0\leq p\leq S  \label{GenMod2} \\
\int_{s=0}^{S}b_{Q}^{2}(p,s,t,\omega )ds &=&1\qquad \qquad \qquad 0\leq
p\leq S  \label{GenMod3} \\
-1 &\leq &\int_{s=0}^{S}b_{Q}(p,s,t,\omega )b_{Q}(p^{\prime },s,t,\omega
)ds\leq 1\qquad 0\leq p,p^{\prime }\leq S
\end{eqnarray}
\end{assumption}

%\bigskip

%\textbf{Definition:\ }

\begin{definition}
The position of the large trader (accumulated since beginning of trading) is
denoted by the predictable process $\theta (t)$. It is also called the
\textit{large trader strategy}. We define $\Theta $ to be the set of
admissible strategies for the large trader.
\end{definition}

%\bigskip

%\textbf{Remark 5:}

\begin{remark}
The large trader may have accumulated shares before the beginning of
trading, but this will not impact the model. Without loss of generality, we
make the following assumption.
\end{remark}

%\bigskip

%\textbf{Assumption 6: }

\begin{assumption}
The large trader cannot buy or sell more than what is available on the
market, and his holdings are bounded by a constant $K$. Namely,%
\begin{equation*}
\Theta =\{\theta (t,\omega )|\max (Q(S,t,\omega ),-K)\leq \theta (t,\omega
)\leq \min (Q(0,t,\omega ),K)\}
\end{equation*}
\end{assumption}

We will add a further condition on $\Theta $ later (see below Assumption~\ref%
{ass::theta_semimartingale}).

\bigskip

\subsection{Conditions for No-Arbitrage}

In order to reuse the no-arbitrage conditions presented in BB04 we need to
express our model in terms of prices and not in terms of quantities.

\bigskip

%\textbf{Definition }

\begin{definition}
The mapping $S$:$\Theta \times \lbrack 0,T]\times \Omega $ $\rightarrow
\lbrack 0,S]$ is the price feedback function. Namely, $S(\theta ,t,\omega )$
is the price faced at time $t$ by the large trader when his trading stategy
is $\theta (u)$ for $0\leq u\leq t.$
\end{definition}

%\bigskip

Since at time $t$ the large trader's position $\theta (t)$ results from
acquiring shares from the atomistic traders, we have the market clearing
equation:

\begin{equation}
Q(S(\theta ,t,\omega ),t,\omega )=\theta (t,\omega )  \label{market_clearing}
\end{equation}

%\textbf{Remark}

\begin{remark}
Observe that, in this model, atomistic traders are myopic in the sense that
their net demand curve $Q(p,t,\omega )$ does not depend on $\theta (t,\omega
)$. As a consequence, as the following easy lemma will show, the trading
strategy of the large trader affects asset prices only via its instantaneous
value.
\end{remark}

%\bigskip

%\textbf{Lemma }

\begin{lemma}
\label{lemma::mapping} There exists a mapping $P:$ $[\tau ,T]\times \lbrack
0,S]\times \Omega $ $\rightarrow \lbrack 0,S]$ such that, $\mathbb{P}$%
-almost surely:%
\begin{equation}
S(\theta ,t,\omega )=P(\theta (t,\omega ),t,\omega )  \label{def_of_P}
\end{equation}
\end{lemma}

\textbf{Sketch of} \textbf{proof of Lemma~\ref{lemma::mapping}} We fix $%
t,\omega $. With obvious notation, (\ref{market_clearing}) can be rewritten:

\begin{equation*}
Q^{t,\omega }(S^{t\,,\omega }(\theta ))=\theta ^{t,\omega }
\end{equation*}

Since $Q$ is strictly decreasing in the first argument, $Q^{t,\omega }$ is
invertible. Thus%
\begin{equation*}
S(\theta ,t,\omega )=(Q^{t,\omega })^{-1}(\theta ^{t,\omega })
\end{equation*}

is a function of $\theta ^{t,\omega }$ only. $\blacksquare $

%\bigskip

%\textbf{Definitions }

\begin{definition}
We call $\ \Xi (t,\omega )$ the set of all $x$ such that such that $x=\theta
(t,\omega )$ and $\theta \in \Theta $. Let $x\in \Xi (t,\omega )$. We call $%
P(x,t)$ the price available on the market at time $t$ when the large
trader's position $\theta (t,\omega )=x$. By definition it satisfies
Equation (\ref{def_of_P}).
\end{definition}

%\bigskip

%\textbf{Assumption 6 bis}

\begin{assumption}
\label{ass::theta_semimartingale} We assume continuous semimartingale
dynamics for $\theta :$

\begin{equation*}
d\theta (t)=\mu _{\theta }(t)dt+\sigma _{\theta }(t)\int_{s=0}^{S}b_{\theta
}(s,t)W(ds,dt)
\end{equation*}

where $\mu _{\theta }$, $\sigma _{\theta }$ and $b_{\theta }$ are bounded in
$L^{2}(\mathbb{R})$, and
\begin{equation*}
\int_{s=0}^1 b_\theta(s,t)^2 ds = 1
\end{equation*}
\end{assumption}

%\bigskip

%\textbf{Remark}

\begin{remark}
\label{rem::boundness_p} BB04 assumes only that $\theta $ is a RCLL
semimartingale. The remark under Lemma 3.2 of BB04 shows that discontinuous
large trader strategies are suboptimal. Thus, for the sake of clarity we
refrain from introducing discontinuous strategies. We note however that we
could, like them, extend the Ito-Wentzell formula to RCLL semimartingales.
\end{remark}

\bigskip

We now assume semimartingale dynamics for the price process $P(x,t)$. We
will verify shortly in lemma~\ref{lemma::para} that this assumption is
plausible. For the moment, the martingale representation theorem (Theorem
4.1 in \cite{CT06}) shows the existence of $\mathcal{F}_{t}$-adapted
processes $\sigma _{P}(x,t)$ and $b_{P}(x,s,t)$ such that:%
\begin{eqnarray}
dP(x,t) &=&\mu _{P}(x,t)dt+\sigma _{P}(x,t)\int_{s=0}^{S}b_{P}(x,s,t)W(ds,dt)
\label{equforP} \\
\int_{s=0}^{S}b_{P}^{2}(x,s,t)ds &=&1
\end{eqnarray}

%\textbf{Definition}

\begin{definition}
For notational convenience, we introduce the cross-variation in the
Ito-Wentzell formula:%
\begin{equation*}
C(p,t,\omega )=-\frac{\sigma _{Q}(p,t,\omega)}{\frac{\partial Q}{\partial p}%
(p,t,\omega)}\int_{s=0}^{S}\frac{\partial \lbrack \sigma _{Q}(p,t,\omega
)b_{Q}(p,s,t,\omega )]}{\partial p}b_{Q}(p,s,t,\omega )ds
\end{equation*}
\end{definition}

%\textbf{Assumption 7}

\begin{assumption}
\label{ass::iwk_condition_Q} We suppose that for each $x\in \Xi (t)$
condition IWK holds for $(Q,\mu _{Q},\sigma _{Q},b_{Q},P(x,.),\mu _{P}(x,.)$%
, $\sigma _{P}(x,.),b_{P}(x,.))$.
\end{assumption}

%\bigskip

%\textbf{Lemma 2: }

\begin{lemma}
\label{lemma::para} Under Assumption~\ref{ass::iwk_condition_Q}:
\begin{eqnarray}
\mu _{P}(x,t) &=&-\frac{\mu _{Q}(P(x,t),t)+\frac{1}{2}\frac{\partial ^{2}Q}{%
\partial p^{2}}(P(x,t),t)\sigma _{P}^{2}(x,t)+C(P(x,t),t)}{\frac{\partial Q}{%
\partial p}(P(x,t),t)}  \label{mu_Px} \\
\sigma _{P}(x,t) &=&\frac{\sigma _{Q}(P(x,t),t)}{\frac{\partial Q}{\partial p%
}(P(x,t),t)}  \label{sigma_P} \\
b_{P}(x,s,t) &=&-b_{Q}(P(x,t),s,t)  \label{b_P}
\end{eqnarray}
\end{lemma}

\textbf{Proof of Lemma~\ref{lemma::para}:}

We rewrite the market clearing equation (\ref{market_clearing})\ as:%
\begin{equation}  \label{eqn::demand_and_price}
Q(P(x,t),t)=x
\end{equation}%
We apply (\ref{ItoWentzell}) to the left side:%
\begin{gather}
dQ(P(x,t),t)=\mu _{Q}(P(x,t),t)dt+\sigma
_{Q}(P(x,t),t)\int_{s=0}^{S}b_{Q}(P(x,t),s,t)W(ds,dt)  \label{ItoWE} \\
+\frac{\partial Q}{\partial p}(P(x,t),t)\left( \mu _{P}(x,t)dt+\sigma
_{P}(x,t)\int_{s=0}^{S}b_{P}(x,s,t)W(ds,dt)\right) +\frac{1}{2}\frac{%
\partial ^{2}Q}{\partial p^{2}}(\sigma _{P}(x,t))^{2}dt+\tilde{C}%
(P(x,t),x,t)dt  \notag
\end{gather}

where:%
\begin{equation*}
\tilde{C}(P(x,t),x,t)=\sigma _{P}(x,t)\int_{s=0}^{S}\frac{\partial \lbrack
\sigma _{Q}(P(x,t),t)b_{Q}(P(x,t),s,t)]}{\partial p}b_{P}(x,s,t)ds
\end{equation*}%
\bigskip

The differential of the right side of (\ref{eqn::demand_and_price})\ is
clearly zero. Setting the volatility part equal to zero yields, for each $%
s\in \lbrack 0,S]$:%
\begin{equation*}
\sigma _{Q}(P(x,t),t)b_{Q}(P(x,t),s,t)+\frac{\partial Q}{\partial p}%
(P(x,t),t)\sigma _{P}(x,t)b_{P}(x,s,t)=0
\end{equation*}%
Thus $\tilde{C}(P(x,t),x,t)=C(P(x,t),t)$. Setting the drift part equal to
zero, we obtain%
\begin{equation}
\mu _{Q}(P(x,t),t)+\frac{\partial Q}{\partial p}(P(x,t),t)\mu _{P}(x,t)+%
\frac{1}{2}\frac{\partial ^{2}Q}{\partial p^{2}}(P(x,t),t)\sigma
_{P}^{2}(x,t)+C(P(x,t),t)=0  \label{drift_is_zero}
\end{equation}

Since, by assumption $\frac{\partial Q}{\partial p}<0$, the expression (\ref%
{mu_Px}) is well-defined.$\blacksquare $

\bigskip

We model liquidity like BB04. Suppose an investor is forced at time zero to
liquidate his stock position $\vartheta $. As the authors say "it is more
convenient to split the sell order into small packages, which would then be
sold one after the other over a small time period. In the limit, as the
packages become ever smaller and as the duration for liquidation tends to
zero [..]" we obtain the following characterization of the asymptotic
liquidation proceeds.

%\bigskip

%\textbf{Definitions \ }

\begin{definition}
The \textit{asymptotic liquidation proceeeds} of the large trader, denoted
by $L$ are equal to:\
\begin{equation*}
L(\vartheta ,t)=\int_{x=0}^{\vartheta }P(x,t)dx
\end{equation*}
\end{definition}

The large trader \textit{holdings in the bank account} are denoted by $\beta
_{t}^{\theta }$. The\textit{\ realizable wealth} of the large trader
achieved by a trading strategy $\theta $ up until time $t$ is denoted by $%
V_{t}^{\theta }$, with:%
\begin{equation*}
V_{t}^{\theta }=\beta _{t}^{\theta }+L(\theta _{t},t)
\end{equation*}

We recall the definition of a stochastic integral with respect to a
semimartingale $L(\vartheta ,ds)$ by starting from the definition:%
\begin{equation*}
\int_{u=0}^{t}L(\theta _{u},du)=\sum_{i}L(\theta _{s_{i}\wedge
t},s_{i+1}\wedge t)-L(\theta _{s_{i}\wedge t},s_{i}\wedge t)
\end{equation*}

for simple integrands of the form $\theta =\sum_{i}\theta
_{i}1_{(s_{i},s_{i+1}]}$ with $0\leq s_{0}\leq ...\leq s_{n}\leq T$ and $%
\theta _{i}\in L^{0}(\mathcal{F}_{s_{i}})$. For more details, we refer the
reader to remark 2.4 in BB04.

\bigskip

We now permute the roles of quantity and price in the application of the
Ito-Wentzell formula. To this effect, we need the following assumption.

%\bigskip

%\textbf{Assumption 8}

\begin{assumption}
\label{ass::iwk_condition_P} We suppose that condition IWK holds for $(P,\mu
_{P},\sigma _{P},b_{P},\theta ,\mu _{\theta },\sigma _{\theta },b_{\theta })$%
.\bigskip
\end{assumption}

The following fact implies that, if $\int_{t=0}^{t}L(\theta _{u},du)$ is a
local martingale under an equivalent martingale measure $\mathbb{Q}$, then
the realizable wealth under $\mathbb{Q}$ will be a supermartingale, since
the term to the right of Equation~(\ref{lemma32BB04}) is positive.

%\bigskip

%\textbf{Fact:}\

\begin{fact}
(Lemma 3.2 in BB04) For any self-financing semimartingale strategy $\theta $%
, under Assumption~\ref{ass::iwk_condition_P}, the dynamics of the real
wealth process $V^{\theta }$ are given by:
\end{fact}

\begin{equation}
V^{\theta }(t)-V^{\theta }(0_{-})=\int_{u=0}^{t}L(\theta _{u-},du)-\frac{1}{2%
}\int_{u=0}^{t}P^{\prime }(\theta _{u},u)d[\theta ,\theta ]_{u}
\label{lemma32BB04}
\end{equation}%
\bigskip

We now investigate conditions for no-arbitrage in the model, but we first
provide motivation for its definition. The payoff of a derivative may depend
on the investor's strategy. Thus, in order to price derivatives a market
model should not have arbitrage, whatever the trading strategy of the large
trader.

\bigskip

%\textbf{Definitions}

\begin{definition}
An\textit{\ arbitrage strategy} is a self-financing trading strategy $\theta
\in \Theta $ such that $V^{\theta }(0_{-})=0$ and:

\begin{eqnarray*}
\mathbb{P}(V^{\theta }(T) &>&0)>0 \\
\mathbb{P}(V^{\theta }(T) &\geq &0)=1
\end{eqnarray*}%
\bigskip \textbf{\ }A \textit{market model has arbitrage} if there exists an
arbitrage strategy $\theta \in \Theta $. The \textit{market price of risk}
is a collection of $\mathcal{F}_{t}$- adapted stochastic processes $\lambda
(s,.)$ for $s\in \lbrack 0,S]$.
\end{definition}

%\bigskip

%\textbf{Definitions}

\begin{definition}
The $\mathbb{Q}$-measure as the measure where the process $W^{\mathbb{Q}}$
is a Brownian sheet, where:%
\begin{equation}
W^{\mathbb{Q}}(ds,dt)=W(ds,dt)+\lambda (s,t)dt  \label{WQ}
\end{equation}

For notational convenience, we define the following processes, for $p\in
\lbrack 0,S]$:%
\begin{eqnarray}
B(p,t) &=&\mu _{Q}(p,t)-\frac{1}{2}\frac{\partial ^{2}Q}{\partial p^{2}}%
(p,t)(\frac{\sigma _{Q}(p,t)}{\frac{\partial Q}{\partial p}(p,t)})^{2}+C(p,t)
\label{DefofB} \\
\Sigma (p,s,t) &=&\sigma _{Q}(p,t,\omega )b_{Q}(p,s,t)  \notag
\end{eqnarray}

The \textit{market price of risk equations} consist of the uncountably
infinite system of equations:
\begin{equation}
\int_{s=0}^{S}\Sigma (p,s,t,\omega )\lambda (s,t,\omega )ds=B(p,t,\omega )%
\text{ \ \ \ \ \ }0\leq p\leq S  \label{MPR}
\end{equation}
\end{definition}

%\textbf{Assumption 9 }\

\begin{assumption}
\label{ass::novikov_condition_lambda} Novikov's condition holds for the
family of processes $\lambda (s,.)$, that is,

\begin{equation}
\mathbb{E}\left[\exp (\int_{t=0}^{T}\int_{s=0}^{S}\lambda (s,t)W(ds,dt)-%
\frac{1}{2}\int_{t=0}^{T}\int_{s=0}^{S}\lambda ^{2}(s,t)dsdt)\right]=1
\label{Novikov}
\end{equation}
\end{assumption}

%\textbf{Theorem}

\begin{theorem}
\label{thm::no_arbitrage} Suppose Assumptions~\ref{ass::decrease_net_demand}
to \ref{ass::novikov_condition_lambda} hold. If the market price of risk
equations (\ref{MPR}) are satisfied, the market model has no arbitrage.
\end{theorem}

\bigskip

\textbf{Proof of Theorem~\ref{thm::no_arbitrage}}

We investigate conditions under which, for all $x\in \Xi (t,\omega )$ there
exists a local martingale measure $\mathbb{Q}$ for $P(x,t)$. As in Lemma~\ref%
{lemma::para}, we calculate the differential of $Q(P(x,t),t)$. We introduce (%
\ref{WQ}) into (\ref{ItoWE}) and obtain:

\begin{gather}
dQ(P(x,t),t)=\mu _{Q}(P(x,t),t)dt-\sigma
_{Q}(P(x,t),t)\int_{s=0}^{S}b_{Q}(P(x,t),s,t)\lambda (s,t)dsdt
\label{dQ_inyheorem} \\
+\sigma _{Q}(P(x,t),t)\int_{s=0}^{S}b_{Q}(P(x,t),s,t)W^{\mathbb{Q}}(ds,dt)
\notag \\
+\frac{\partial Q}{\partial p}(P(x,t),t)\left( \mu _{P}(x,t)-\sigma
_{P}(x,t)\int_{s=0}^{S}b_{P}(x,s,t)\lambda (s,t)ds\right) dt  \notag \\
+\frac{\partial Q}{\partial p}(P(x,t),t)\sigma
_{P}(x,t)\int_{s=0}^{S}b_{P}(P(x,t),s,t)W^{\mathbb{Q}}(ds,dt)  \notag \\
+\frac{1}{2}\frac{\partial ^{2}Q}{\partial p^{2}}(\sigma
_{P}(x,t))^{2}dt+C(P(x,t),t)dt  \notag
\end{gather}

By definition the drift of $P(x,t)$ in the measure $\mathbb{Q}$ is zero. We
thus obtain:%
\begin{equation}
\mu _{P}(x,t)-\sigma _{P}(x,t)\int_{s=0}^{S}b_{P}(x,s,t)\lambda (s,t)ds=0
\label{MPR_star}
\end{equation}

We set $dQ(P(x,t),t)=0$ as in Lemma~\ref{lemma::para}. We insert (\ref%
{MPR_star})\ in (\ref{dQ_inyheorem})\ and set the drift part equal to zero:
\begin{gather}
\mu _{Q}(P(x,t),t)-\sigma
_{Q}(P(x,t),t)\int_{s=0}^{S}b_{Q}(P(x,t),s,t)\lambda (s,t)ds  \notag \\
+\frac{1}{2}\frac{\partial ^{2}Q}{\partial p^{2}}(\sigma
_{P}(x,t))^{2}+C(P(x,t),t)=0  \label{sigma_P_bis}
\end{gather}

Setting the volatility in (\ref{dQ_inyheorem})\ equal to zero, we obtain (%
\ref{sigma_P})\ and (\ref{b_P}), and thus (\ref{sigma_P_bis}) can be
rewritten:%
\begin{equation}
\sigma _{Q}(P(x,t),t)\int_{s}b_{Q}(P(x,t),s,t)\lambda (s,t)ds=\mu
_{Q}(P(x,t),t)+\frac{1}{2}\frac{\partial ^{2}Q}{\partial p^{2}}(\sigma
_{Q}(P(x,t),t)^{2}dt+C(P(x,t),t)dt  \label{stoch_MPR}
\end{equation}%
\bigskip

This set of equations must hold for each value $P(x,t)$. Since $P(x,t)\in
\lbrack 0,S]$, existence of a solution to the market price of risk equations
are sufficient for (\ref{stoch_MPR})\ to hold. Under Assumption~\ref%
{ass::novikov_condition_lambda}, we can assume that Girsanov's theorem holds
(see, e.g. Theorem 10.14 in \cite{DPZ92}), so that there exists a local
martingale measure $\mathbb{Q}$ for $P(x,t)$. By assumption \ref%
{ass::theta_semimartingale} we can invoke (\ref{lemma32BB04}) as well as
Theorem 3.3 in BB04.$\blacksquare $

\bigskip

What happens when the market price of risk equations are not satisfied?
Then, generically, there is no equivalent martingale measure $\mathbb{Q}$
such that, for all $\theta \in \Theta $ the real wealth process $V^{\theta }$
is a local martingale. The first fundamental theorem shows that no arbitrage
for small investors is essentially equivalent to the existence of this
equivalent martingale measure (BB04 p.8). More precisely, if there is no
free lunch with vanishing risk (NFLVR), then there should exist an
equivalent martingale measure $\mathbb{Q}$. To our knowledge, no rigorous
proof of this result exists in the literature, so we content ourselves with
the following generic example, to show that a market model with only two
Brownian motions admits arbitrage.

\bigskip

\subsection{Liquidity Arbitrage with a Finite Number of Brownian Motions: an
Example}

Consider two stocks with price $P^{(1)}$ and $P^{(2)}$. The large trader has
a position $\theta ^{(1)}$ in stock 1 and $\theta ^{(2)}$ in stock 2. These
stocks are correlated, so we assume a simple model with two Brownian
motions, $W_{1}$ and $W_{2}$. It should be clear that the same reasoning
applies to a model with a finite number of Brownian motions. We assume that
the drift or volatility coefficient depends on $x$, except one, the
volatility coefficient of the second price with respect to the second
Brownian motion. We have then:%
\begin{eqnarray*}
dP^{(1)}(x,t,\omega ) &=&\mu _{P}^{(1)}(x,\omega )dt+\sigma
_{P,1}^{(1)}(x,\omega )dW_{1}(t,\omega )+\sigma _{P,2}^{(1)}(x,\omega
)dW_{2}(t,\omega ) \\
dP^{(2)}(x,t,\omega ) &=&\mu _{P}^{(2)}(x,\omega )dt+\sigma
_{P,1}^{(2)}(x,\omega )dW_{1}(t,\omega )+\sigma _{P,2}^{(2)}(x,\omega
)xdW_{2}(t,\omega )
\end{eqnarray*}

We assume regularity of the stochastic matrix:
\begin{equation*}
\left[
\begin{array}{cc}
\sigma _{P,1}^{(1)} & \sigma _{P,2}^{(1)} \\
\sigma _{P,1}^{(2)} & \sigma _{P,2}^{(2)}%
\end{array}%
\right]
\end{equation*}

and that the process $\bar{\theta}$ defined in (\ref{theta_bar_1}),(\ref%
{theta_bar_2}) has finite variation. Set $\sigma_{P,1}^{(1)} \neq 0$ and $%
\sigma_{P,2}^{(2)} \neq 0$. Then, by Fubini's theorem for stochastic
integral (Theorem IV.46 in \cite{PP04}),%
\begin{eqnarray}
\int_{u=0}^{t}L(\theta ,du) &=&\int_{u=0}^{t}\theta ^{(1)}(u)\mu
_{P}^{(1)}+\theta ^{(2)}(u)\mu _{P}^{(2)}du  \label{Lds} \\
&&+\int_{u=0}^{t}S_{1}(u)dW_{1}(u)+\int_{u=0}^{t}S_{2}(u)dW_{2}(u)  \notag
\end{eqnarray}

where the diffusion coefficient of the proceeds of a fast liquidation
strategy are:%
\begin{eqnarray}
S_{1} &=&\sigma _{P,1}^{(1)}\theta ^{(1)}+\sigma _{P,1}^{(2)}\theta ^{(2)} \\
S_{2} &=&\sigma _{P,2}^{(1)}\theta ^{(1)}+\sigma _{P,2}^{(2)}(\theta
^{(2)})^{2}/2
\end{eqnarray}

We fix time $s$ and set $S_{1}$ and $S_{2}$ to zero. Eliminating $\theta
^{(1)}$ yields:
\begin{equation*}
\sigma _{P,2}^{(1)}\sigma _{P,1}^{(2)}\theta ^{(2)}-\sigma
_{P,1}^{(1)}\sigma _{P,2}^{(2)}(\theta ^{(2)})^{2}/2=0
\end{equation*}

Apart from $\theta =0$, an obvious solution is $\theta =\bar{\theta}$, where:%
\begin{eqnarray}
\bar{\theta}^{(1)} &=&-2\frac{\sigma_{P,2}^{(1)}\left(\sigma_{P,1}^{(2)}
\right)^2} {\sigma_{P,2}^{(2)}\left(\sigma_{P,1}^{(1)}\right)^2}
\label{theta_bar_1} \\
\bar{\theta}^{(2)} &=&2\frac{\sigma _{P,2}^{(1)}\sigma _{P,1}^{(2)}}{\sigma
_{P,2}^{(2)}\sigma _{P,1}^{(1)}}  \label{theta_bar_2}
\end{eqnarray}

By the assumption of finite variation of $\bar{\theta}$, we have:%
\begin{eqnarray*}
V^{\bar{\theta}}(t)-V^{\bar{\theta}}(0_{-}) &=&\int_{u=0}^{t}L(\bar{\theta}%

&=&\int_{u=0}^{t}\mu _{P}^{(1)}\bar{\theta}^{(1)}(u)+\mu _{P}^{(2)}\bar{%

&=&\int_{u=0}^{t}\bar{\theta}^{(2)}(u)(-\frac{\sigma _{P,1}^{(2)}}{\sigma
_{P,1}^{(1)}}\mu _{P}^{(1)}+\mu _{P}^{(2)})du
\end{eqnarray*}

Thus, if $\mu _{P}^{(2)}>\frac{\sigma _{P,1}^{(2)}}{\sigma _{P,1}^{(1)}}\mu
_{P}^{(1)}$, then:
\begin{equation*}
V^{\bar{\theta}}(t)-V^{\bar{\theta}}(0_{-})\geq 0
\end{equation*}%

\subsection{A Market Model Satisfying all Assumptions}

We introduce two new variables to define the market model. First, we
introduce a positive demand density string $q$, such that $-Q(p,.)$ will be
defined as the integral (with respect to the first argument) of $q(.,.)$.
Thus $Q$ will be strictly decreasing in terms of the price argument, and
thus satisfy assumption 3. The fact that $Q$ is strictly decreasing in price
ensures that there is at most one solution (called the \textit{clearing}, or
\textit{equilibrium price}) $\pi (t)$ to the market clearing equation $Q(\pi
(t),t)=0$. To make sure that there exists a solution, we introduce a net
demand ratio process $\eta $. As we see in remark 10, this will result in
the fact that $Q(0,t)>0$ and $Q(S,t)<0$, thus ensuring that $\pi (t)\in (0,S)
$.

\subsubsection{Definition of the Demand Density}

We take as our underlying string the derivative (with respect to the price
argument)\ of the logarithm of\ the demand density $q$, which we call $h$. A
simpler model would be to take $q$ directly as the underlying string,
however we would need to specify a differentiability assumption on the
volatility of $q$ for the IKW condition to hold. This explanation may puzzle
the reader: we further require in this theoretical section that the
volatility of $h$ be twice differentiable. However, our smoothness
requirement of $h$ serves only a theoretical purpose: guaranteing that the
market price of risk equations will have a solution. In practice (see next
section), we did not specify a smooth volatility of $h$, and still observed
that the market price of risk equations were satisfied. Empirically however,
the specification (\ref{Def_of_q}) proved to be critical.

\bigskip

Let $\varepsilon >0$, and $0<\delta _{0}<\delta _{1}<S$. We define $a$, $%
\bar{h}$, $\sigma _{h}$ and $b_{h}(.,s)$ (for $s\in \lbrack 0,S]$) to be
twice continuously differentiable deterministic functions of the first
argument $x$, bounded on $x\in \lbrack -\varepsilon ,S]$ and such that

\begin{itemize}
\item $b_{h}(x,s)=0$ for $0\leq s\leq \delta _{0}$, and $x\in \lbrack
-\varepsilon ,0)$

\item $b_{h}(x,s)=0$ for $0\leq s\leq \delta _{1}$, and $x\in \lbrack 0,S]$

\item $\int\limits_{0}^{S}b_{h}(x,s)^{2}ds=1$

\item $a(x)\geq 0,\sigma _{h}(x)$ strictly positive and uniformly bounded
above and away from zero.
\end{itemize}

We now define the string $h$ to be an Ornstein-Uhlenbeck sheet. For all $%
x\in \lbrack -\varepsilon ,S]$ and all $t\geq 0$:%
\begin{eqnarray} \label{equ_h_A}
h(x,t) &=&h_{0,x}\exp (-a(x)t)+\bar{h}(x)(1-\exp (-a(x)t))+
\\
&&\sigma _{h}(x)\int_{u=0}^{t}\exp
(-a(x)(t-u))\int_{s=0}^{S}b_{h}(x,s)W(ds,du)  \notag
\end{eqnarray}

For $h$ to be twice differentiable in $x$ we will need the following
condition. The process $\rho (x,y)$ defined as:%
\begin{equation}
\rho _{h}(x,y)=\int\limits_{s=0}^{S}b_{h}(x,s)b_{h}(y,s)ds\text{ \ \ \ \ \ \
}x,y\in \lbrack -\varepsilon ,S]  \label{rho_h}
\end{equation}%
\bigskip

will need to be a correlation function, i.e., satisfy $-1\leq \rho _{h}\leq 1
$. We require the second derivatives of $\sigma _{h}(x)\sigma _{h}(y)\rho
_{h}(x,y)$ to be H\"{o}lder continuous for some index $\delta >0$. We also
make the assumption that the bounded linear operator $B_{h}:E\rightarrow E$
given by%
\begin{equation*}
(B_{h}f)(p)=\int_{s=\delta _{1}}^{S}b_{h}(p,u)f(u)du
\end{equation*}%
\bigskip

has full rank.

\bigskip

%\textbf{Remark }

\begin{remark}
The reason why the support for the factor loadings $b_{h}$ is not $[0,S]$
but $[-\varepsilon ,S]$ is purely technical, i.e, to have a solution to the
market price of risk equations in a continuous model. In a discrete model
(see next section), this is not necessary. The reason why $b_{h}(x,s)=0$ for
$0\leq s\leq \delta _{1}$, and $x\in \lbrack 0,S]$ is also linked to the
existence of a solution to the market price of risk equations.
%(see the proof of proposition 3.65 RAN verify). 
The assumption that $B_{h,p}$ has full rank
is quite innocuous in practice. We will see in the empirical section that it
was always verified.\bigskip
\end{remark}

We now define, for $t\geq 0$, and $p\in \lbrack -\varepsilon ,S]$ the demand
density string:%
\begin{equation}
q(p,t)=\exp ({\int_{x=-\varepsilon }^{p}h(x,t)dx)}  \label{Def_of_q}
\end{equation}

beThis string is clearly a.s. strictly positive as well as differentiable in
$p$.

\subsection{Definition of the Demand String}

Let

\begin{itemize}
\item $a_{\eta }$ be nonnegative and bounded

\item $\bar{\eta},\eta ^{0}\in (0,1)$

\item $g$  a nonnegative bounded Lipschitz continuous function such that $%
g(\eta )=0$ if $\eta \leq 0$ or $\eta \geq 1$.
\end{itemize}

We also define factor loadings $b_{\eta }$ on $[0,S]$. They are such that:%
\begin{eqnarray}
-1 &\leq &\int_{s=0}^{S}b_{h}(p,s)b_{\eta }(p,s)ds\leq 1\text{\ \ \ \ \ \ \ }%
\forall p\in \lbrack -\varepsilon ,S]  \label{bh} \\
\int_{s=0}^{S}b_{\eta }^{2}(s)ds &=&1  \label{b_eta}
\end{eqnarray}%
\bigskip

We now define the net demand ratio $\eta $ as the process:%
\begin{equation}
d\eta (t)=a_{\eta }(\bar{\eta}-\eta (t))dt+g(\eta (t))\int_{s=0}^{S}b_{\eta
}(s)W(ds,dt)\text{.......}\eta (0)=\eta ^{0}  \label{equ_for_eta}
\end{equation}

Clearly this is a double-barrier process, with, $0\leq \eta (t)\leq 1$. We
assume a specification such that the inequalities are strict almost surely%
%\textbf{Remark}

\begin{remark}
Lipschitz continuity of $g$ ensures that ($\ref{equ_for_eta})$ has a
solution. A possible form (which is not Lipschitz continuous, but can be
mollified into one)\ is:%
\begin{equation*}
g(\eta )=\sigma _{\eta }\sqrt{\eta (1-\eta )}
\end{equation*}
\end{remark}

We now define demand, for $p\in \lbrack 0,S]$ and $t\geq 0$ by:%
\begin{equation} \label{eqn_Q}
Q(p,t)=\eta (t)\int_{x=0}^{S}q(x,t)dx-\int_{x=0}^{p}q(x,t)dx
\end{equation}

%\textbf{Remark}

\begin{remark}
Observe that, by evaluating
(\ref{eqn_Q})\ at $p=0$ and $p=S$, we can solve for $\eta $:%
\begin{equation}
\eta (t)=\frac{Q(0,t)}{Q(0,t)-Q(S,t)}  \label{eta}
\end{equation}
\end{remark}

In other words it is the ratio of the quantity of all shares available for
purchase over the quantity of shares available for purchase or for sale,
and, as such should lie between zero and one. This is indeed satisfied by
our model for $\eta $. Clearly $Q(0,t)>0$ and $Q(S,t)<0$ a.s. for each $t$.
Moreover we see that:

\begin{equation*}
q(p,t)=-\frac{\partial Q(p,t)}{dp}
\end{equation*}

is indeed the demand density.

\bigskip

\begin{proposition}
Assumptions \ref{ass::decrease_net_demand} and \ref{ass::demand_twice_diff}
are satisfied, namely $Q$ is strictly decreasing in $p$ and
twice-differentiable in $p$.
\end{proposition}

\textbf{Proof}. Assumption \ref{ass::decrease_net_demand} is satisfied
trivially by differentiating (\ref{eqn_Q}) with respect to $p$ and observing
that $q$ is positive. Since $q$ is differentiable in $p$, $Q$ is
twice-differentiable in $p$.

\bigskip

%\textbf{Proposition:}

\begin{proposition}
Under Assumption~\ref{ass::theta_semimartingale}, our model satisfies
Assumptions, \ref{ass::iwk_condition_Q}, \ref{ass::iwk_condition_P}, and \ref%
{ass::novikov_condition_lambda}. Also, the market price of risk equations (%
\ref{MPR}) hold.
\end{proposition}

We can thus conclude that there is no arbitrage in our model.

\section{Empirical Analysis}

As mentioned in the introduction, we argue that in equilibrium the large
trader is statistically indistinguishable from an atomistic trader. The
clearing price $\pi (t)$ on the exchange will thus be%
\begin{equation*}
\pi (t)\equiv P(0,t)
\end{equation*}

so that $Q(\pi (t),t)=0$. In this section, we calibrate the market model and
then simulate it in the risk-neutral measure to price options. We use intra-day
order book data of a magnitude of a millisecond. Then the
calibrated parameters are utilized in the discretized simulation model in
both the physical and risk-neutral measures. When simulating the net demand
curve $Q$ in the risk neutral measure, the market price of risk equation is
solved. As expected, we could not find any case where the market price of
risk equation does not have a solution.

\subsection{Data}

The trading data are collected from the NYSE Arcabook limit orders for April
2011. Historical NYSE Arcabook data provide information of the complete
limit order book (LOB) from NYSE, NYSE Arca, NYSE MKT, NASDAQ and the
ArcaEdge platforms from 3:30 a.m. to 8:00 p.m. ET under high speed of
latencies (less than 5 milliseconds). Each limit order contains the unique
reference number, the time stamp in seconds and milliseconds, the limit
price in U.S. dollars, the quantity in number of shares, and the trading
type (\textquotedblleft B\textquotedblright : buy or \textquotedblleft
S\textquotedblright :sell).

All the limit order book records are categorized into three groups:
\textquotedblleft A\textquotedblright\ Add, \textquotedblleft
M\textquotedblright\ Modified and \textquotedblleft D\textquotedblright\
Deleted. For the market liquidity model, we consider the net demand of the
stock, which is captured by summing added records (\textquotedblleft
A\textquotedblright ) with modified (\textquotedblleft M\textquotedblright )
adjustment and subtracting the deleted orders. To be specific, within a
certain partitioned time period, the added orders would be updated by the
modified orders, if applicable and the orders occur in the same partitioned
period.

In this section, we use the time series of Apple Inc. stock (AAPL) as of
April 1st 2011 for calibration.

\bigskip

\subsection{Discretized Model}

The price variable $p$ belongs to the set $\{0,\Delta p,2\Delta p,..,I\Delta
p\}$ where $I=401$ and $\Delta p=\$1.91$. This corresponds for our data set
to a winsorization at the 99\% quantile of the price for all the limit
orders within the trading day. The variable $s$ will belong to the same set,
so we set $\Delta s=\Delta p$. The variable $t$ will be a multiple of $%
\Delta t$, for $\Delta t$=15 minutes. For any function $f$ of real-valued
variables $p=k\Delta p,$ $s=i\Delta s$ and $t=j\Delta t$ we streamline the
notation by writing:
\begin{eqnarray*}
f(k,i,j) &\leftarrow &f(k\Delta p,i\Delta s,j\Delta t) \\
\Delta f(k,i,j) &=&f(k,i,j+1)-f(k,i,j)
\end{eqnarray*}
We denote observed quantities by $\hat{f}(t)$ and simulated quantities by $%
f(t)$. We discretize the model (\ref{equ_h_A}) to (\ref{eqn_Q}), and
simplify it by setting most of the drifts equal to zero. Let $\{z(i,j)\}$ be
a collection of standard normal random variates where $0\leq i\leq I$, and
the values of $j$ will be clear from context. After initializing all
stochastic processes, we use the Euler scheme:%
\begin{eqnarray}
\Delta h(k,j) &=&\sigma _{h}(k)\sum_{i=2}^{I}b_{h}(k,i)z(i,j)\sqrt{\Delta
s\Delta t}\text{ \ \ \ }2\leq k\leq I  \label{Euler_1} \\
\Delta q(1,j) &=&\sigma _{q}(1)\sum_{i=2}^{I}b_{q}(1,i)z(i,j)\sqrt{\Delta
s\Delta t}  \label{Euler_2} \\
\Delta \eta (j) &=&a_{\eta }(\bar{\eta}-\eta (j))\Delta t+\sigma _{\eta }%
\sqrt{\eta (j)(1-\eta (j))}\sum_{i=0}^{I}b_{\eta }(i)z(i,j)\sqrt{\Delta
s\Delta t}  \label{Euler_3}
\end{eqnarray}

We then complete the model by setting, for \ $2\leq k\leq I$:%
\begin{eqnarray*}
q(k,j) &=&q(1,j)\exp \left( {\sum_{i=2}^{k}h(i,j)\Delta p}\right) \text{ \ \
} \\
Q(0,j) &=&\frac{\eta (j)}{2-\eta (j)}\sum_{i=1}^{I}q(i,j){\Delta p} \\
Q(k,j) &=&[Q(0,j)+\sum_{i=1}^{I}q(i,j)\Delta p]\eta
(j)-[Q(0,j)+\sum_{i=1}^{k}q(i,j)\Delta p]
\end{eqnarray*}

\subsection{Calibration Methodology}

The number of observations is equal to $N=32$. The purpose of aggregating millisecond 
order book data to a lower frequency intra-day data is to smooth out the demand surface
 and to populate adequate data observations on each demand surface grid. Observation times take values
in the set $\{-N\Delta t,-(N-1)\Delta t,..,0\}$. Since each time step
represents an interval of 15 minutes. we use all the dates between April 1st
9 AM and April 1st 5PM, which covers the regular trading hours during the
day. The net demand $Q$ at price $p$ is calculated, by definition as:

\begin{gather*}
\hat{Q}(k,.)=\text{quantity of shares available for purchase at a price }>k{%
\Delta p} \\
\text{ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ }-\text{quantity of shares available for sale at a
price }<k{\Delta p}
\end{gather*}

A typical net demand $\hat{Q}$ surface as a function of price and time for
AAPL stock on April 1st, 2011 is shown in Figure~\ref%
{fig::AAPL_20110401_Calibration_Q}.

\begin{center}
\begin{figure}[tbp]
\centering
% Requires \usepackage{graphicx}
\includegraphics[scale = 0.7]{AAPL_20110401_Calibration_Q.eps}\newline
\caption{The calculated net demand surface $Q$ by price and time, from
market data for AAPL as of April 1st, 2011.}
\label{fig::AAPL_20110401_Calibration_Q}
\end{figure}
\end{center}

After the net demand surface $\hat{Q}$ is calculated, the net demand density
$\hat{q}$ is calculated by taking the first order difference of $\hat{Q}(p)$:

\begin{equation*}
\hat{q}(k,j)=-\frac{\hat{Q}(k,j)-\hat{Q}(k-1,j)}{\Delta p}\text{, \ \ \ \ \ }%
1\leq k\leq I
\end{equation*}

Discretization of (\ref{equ_h_A}) yields:%
\begin{equation*}
\hat{h}(k,j)=\frac{1}{\Delta p}(\log (\hat{q}(k,j))-\log {\hat{q}(k-1,j)),}%
\text{ \ \ \ \ \ }2\leq k\leq I
\end{equation*}%
The net demand elasticity $\hat{\eta}$ is calculated by (\ref{eta}). We
estimate the instantaneous variances by the method of moments:
\begin{eqnarray*}
\hat{\sigma}_{\eta }^{2} &=&\frac{1}{N\Delta t}\sum_{j=-N}^{-1}\frac{\Delta
\hat{\eta}(j)^{2}}{\hat{\eta}(j)(1-\hat{\eta}(j))} \\
\hat{\sigma}_{q}^{2}(1) &=&\frac{1}{N\Delta t}\sum_{j=-N}^{-1}\Delta \hat{q}%
(1,j)^{2} \\
\hat{\sigma}_{h}^{2}(k) &=&\frac{1}{N\Delta t}\sum_{j=-N}^{-1}\Delta \hat{h}%
(k,j)^{2}\text{\ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ }k=2,...,S
\end{eqnarray*}

We do the same for the instantaneous covariances:%
\begin{eqnarray*}
\hat{s}_{\eta ,q}^{2}(1) &=&\frac{1}{N\Delta t}\sum_{j=-N}^{-1}\Delta \hat{%
\eta}(j)\Delta \hat{q}(1,j) \\
\hat{s}_{\eta ,h}^{2}(k) &=&\frac{1}{N\Delta t}\sum_{j=-N}^{-1}\frac{\Delta
\hat{\eta}(j)\Delta \hat{h}(k,j)}{\sqrt{\eta (j)(1-\eta (j))}}\text{ \ \ \ \
\ \ \ \ \ \ }k=2,...,S \\
\hat{s}_{q,h}^{2}(1,k) &=&\frac{1}{N\Delta t}\sum_{j=-N}^{-1}\Delta \hat{q}%
(1,j)\Delta \hat{h}(k,j)\text{ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ }k=2,...,S
\\
\hat{s}_{h}^{2}(k_{1},k_{2}) &=&\frac{1}{N\Delta t}\sum_{j=-N}^{-1}\Delta
\hat{h}(k_{1},j)\Delta \hat{h}(k_{2},j)\text{ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \
\ \ }k_{1},k_{2}=2,...,S
\end{eqnarray*}

We organize the instantaneous variance-covariance matrix as:%
\begin{equation*}
V=\left(
\begin{array}{ccccc}
\hat{\sigma}_{\eta }^{2} & \hat{s}_{\eta ,q}^{2}(1) & \hat{s}_{\eta
,h}^{2}(2) &  & \hat{s}_{\eta ,h}^{2}(I) \\
\hat{s}_{\eta ,q}^{2}(1) & \hat{\sigma}_{q}^{2}(1) & \hat{s}_{q,h}^{2}(1,2)
& \cdots & \hat{s}_{q_{,}h}^{2}(1,I) \\
\hat{s}_{\eta ,h}^{2}(2) & \hat{s}_{q,h}^{2}(1,2) & \hat{\sigma}_{h}^{2}(2)
& \cdots & \hat{s}_{h}^{2}(2,I) \\
\vdots & \vdots & \vdots & \ddots & \vdots \\
\hat{s}_{\eta ,h}^{2}(I) & \hat{s}_{q_{,}h}^{2}(1,I) & \hat{s}_{h}^{2}(2,I)
& \cdots & \hat{\sigma}_{h}^{2}(I)%
\end{array}%
\right)
\end{equation*}%
The factor loading matrix $B$ is the square root of the correlation matrix
corresponding to $V$. It is made of the following coefficients:%
\begin{equation*}
\hat{B}=\left(
\begin{array}{ccccc}
\hat{b}_{\eta }(0) & 0 & \cdots & \cdots & \cdots \\
\hat{b}_{\eta }(1) & \hat{b}_{q}(1,1) & \ddots &  & \vdots \\
& \vdots & \hat{b}_{h}(2,1) & \ddots & \vdots \\
& \vdots & \vdots & \ddots & 0 \\
\hat{b}_{\eta }(I) & \hat{b}_{q}(1,I) & \hat{b}_{h}(I,1) & \cdots & \hat{b}%
_{h}(I,I)%
\end{array}%
\right)
\end{equation*}

We use Cholesky decomposition to calculate $\hat{B}.$

\bigskip

In the simulation, we use $a_\eta = 0.9$, $\bar{\eta}=0.6$ and $\sigma_\eta
= 0.1$.

\subsection{Simulation "in the $\mathbb{P}$ Measure"}

The simulated net demand curve under physical measure using the above
methods is shown in left graph of Figure~\ref%
{fig::AAPL_20110401_simulated_both_measures}.

\begin{center}
\begin{figure}[tbp]
\centering
% Requires \usepackage{graphicx}
\includegraphics[scale = 0.5]{Q_both_measures.eps}\newline
\caption{The simulated net demand surface Q(p,t) under physical measure
(left) and risk neutral measure (right).}
\label{fig::AAPL_20110401_simulated_both_measures}
\end{figure}
\end{center}

\subsection{Simulation "in the $\mathbb{Q}$ Measure"}

Let $k^{\ast }(j)$ be the index of the approximate clearing price, i.e., the
value of $k$ that minimizes $|Q(k,j)|$.

We first need to solve the market price of risk equations. Expressions for $%
\mu _{Q}(k,j)$ and $\sigma _{Q}(k,j)$ and $b_{Q}(k,i,j)$ are obtained by
discretization of Equations~\ref{sigma_Q} and \ref{Ah} (RAN) in the appendix. Remember that:

\begin{equation*}
\Sigma(k,i,j)=\sigma _{Q}(k,j)b_{Q}(k,i,j)
\end{equation*}

We calculate:

\begin{eqnarray*}
\sigma _{\pi }(j)b_{\pi }(i,j) &=&-\frac{\Sigma(k^{\ast }(j),i,j)}{q(k^{\ast
}(j),j)} \\
C(k,j) &=&\sigma _{\pi }(j)\sum_{i=0}^{I}\frac{\Sigma(k^{\ast
}(j),i,j)-\Sigma(k^{\ast }(j)-1,i,j)}{\Delta p}b_{\pi }(i,j) \\
B(k,j) &=&\mu _{Q}(k,j)-\frac{1}{2}\frac{Q(k+1,j)-2Q(k,j)+Q(k-1,j)}{\Delta
p^{2}}+C(k,j)
\end{eqnarray*}

The market price of risk equations are, for each scenario and each time $j$:

\begin{eqnarray}  \label{eqn::market_price_risk_equation}
\sum_{i=0}^{I}\Sigma(k,i,j)\lambda (i,j)=B(k,j)\text{ \ \ \ }k=0,...,I
\end{eqnarray}

Now let $\{z^{\mathbb{Q}}(i,j)\}$ be a collection of standard normal random
variates. It remains only to make the substitution:

\begin{equation*}
z(i,j)=z^{\mathbb{Q}}(i,j)\sqrt{\Delta t\Delta s}-\lambda (i,j)\sqrt{\Delta s%
}
\end{equation*}

in our model (\ref{Euler_1})\ to (\ref{Euler_3}) to obtain the risk-neutral
model.

The simulated net demand surfaces under risk neutral measure is shown in the
right graph of Figure~\ref{fig::AAPL_20110401_simulated_both_measures}. The
range of the difference on net demand (over time and price) between $\mathbb{%
P}$-measure simulation and $\mathbb{Q}$-measure simulation is $%
[-50.22,66.10] $ in the case shown in the simulation.

\subsection{Option Pricing}

With the simulations under risk neutral measure, the corresponding call/put
option price, $c(\pi, \omega)$, with strike $K$ at given time $t$ is

\begin{eqnarray*}
c(K) &=& \frac{1}{N} \sum_{\omega} \max\left(\pi(t,\omega)-K,0\right) \\
p(K) &=& \frac{1}{N} \sum_{\omega} \max\left(K - \pi(t,\omega),0\right)
\qquad \omega = 1,2,\ldots,N
\end{eqnarray*}

where $\pi$ is the clearing price at simulation time $t$. With the option
prices, the implied volatility for different strike levels are calculated by
solving

\begin{equation*}
p(K)=BS(\pi ,K,r,T,\sigma (K))
\end{equation*}%
where $BS$ is the Black-Scholes function, $\pi $ is the clearing price, $K$
is the strike level, $r$ is the interest rate, $T$ is time to maturity and $%
p $ is the put option price corresponding to the strike $K$. The implied
volatility $\sigma (K)$ is being solved.

The implied volatility smile generated from the equity options at simulation
period is shown in Figure~\ref{fig::Put_Option_Vols} (right graph). The
implied volatilities by simulations under risk neutral measure are plotted
as blue line, which are compared to the real historical implied volatility
levels from Bloomberg (historical market quotes). The interest rate level is
selected as 0.301\% at real historical level, and the dividend yield is set
to 0\%. The maturity of the option is 60 days. The simulation is evaluated
under 500 scenarios.

The at-the-money simulated implied volatility is within 5\% error range of
the Bloomberg quote, at 25\% level. For low strike options the simulation
results tend to be steeper than the Bloomberg volatility, and the percentage
difference between simulation results and Bloomberg volatilities is within
+/- 10\%. As for the high strike options, the simulation results are flatter
than Bloomberg volatilities.

The left graph in Figure~\ref{fig::Put_Option_Vols} plots the solution of
market price of risk equation \ref{eqn::market_price_risk_equation} ($%
\lambda(i,j)$) over time, evaluated on at-the-money price levels. In our
simulation process, the market price of risk equation is always solvable
through matrix inversion.

\appendix

\subsection{Proof of Proposition 2}

To prove boundedness in IWK, we will make use of the following elementary
lemma, which is a direct application of the Chebyshev, Cauchy, and Jensen
inequalities. Clearly, better bounds can be obtained, but we are not looking
for the best bounds possible.

%\paragraph{Lemma 888}

\begin{lemma}
\label{lemma::finite_eighth_moment} \textit{Let }$Y_{i}(s,t)$\textit{\ and }$%
Z_{i}(s,t)$\textit{\ be collections of random variables, for }$i=1,...,n$%
\textit{, }$0\leq s\leq S$\textit{, and }$0\leq t\leq T$\textit{. Suppose }$|%
\mathbb{E}[\int_{0}^{S}\int_{0}^{T}\sum_{i=1}^{n}Y_{i}(s,t)Z_{i}(s,t)dtds]|<%
\infty $\textit{. A sufficient condition for }%
\begin{equation*}
\mathbb{P}\left(\int_{s=0}^{S}\int_{t=0}^{T}%
\sum_{i=1}^{n}Y_{i}(s,t)Z_{i}(s,t)dtds<\infty \right)=1
\end{equation*}

\textit{is that for all }$s,t$\textit{\ and }$i=1,..,n$%
\begin{eqnarray*}
\mathbb{E}[Y_{i}(s,t)^{8}] &<&\infty  \\
\mathbb{E}[Z_{i}(s,t)^{8}] &<&\infty
\end{eqnarray*}
\end{lemma}

\subsection{Preliminary Calculations}

Differentiating (\ref{eqn_Q}), we have:

\begin{eqnarray}
\frac{\partial Q(p,t)}{\partial p} &=&-\exp \left( {\int_{x=-\varepsilon
}^{p}h(x,t)dx}\right)  \label{dQdp_3} \\
\frac{\partial ^{2}Q(p,t)}{\partial p^{2}} &=&-{h(p,t)}\exp \left( {%
\int_{x=-\varepsilon }^{p}h(x,t)dx}\right)  \label{dQdp_2_3}
\end{eqnarray}

As for the infinitesimal parameters of $Q$, let $f(p,t)$ be the drift of $%
\int_{x=0}^{p}q(x,t)dx$. By Ito's lemma:
\begin{equation*}
f(p,t)=\int_{x=0}^{p}q(x,t)\left[ \int_{y=-\varepsilon }^{x}a(y)(\bar{h}%
(y)-h(y,t))dy\right] +\left[ \int_{y=-\varepsilon }^{x}\int_{y^{\prime
}=-\varepsilon }^{x}\frac{Cov[dh(y,t),dh(y^{\prime }(t)]}{2dt}dydy^{\prime }%
\right] dx
\end{equation*}

By Ito's lemma again, the drift of $Q(p,t)$ is:%
\begin{eqnarray}
\mu _{Q}(p,t) &=&\eta (t)f(S,t)-f(p,t)+  \label{mu_Q} \\
&&a_{\eta }(\bar{\eta}-\eta (t))\int_{x=0}^{S}q(x,t){dx+}  \notag \\
&&g(\eta (t))\int_{x=0}^{S}q(x,t)\int_{y=-\varepsilon }^{x}\rho _{h,\eta }(y)%
{\sigma _{h}(y)dydx}  \notag
\end{eqnarray}

where $\rho _{h,\eta }(x)$ is the instantaneous correlation of $h(x)$ and $%
\eta $. The volatility of $Q(p,t)$ is:%
\begin{eqnarray}
\Sigma (p,s,t) &=&g(\eta (t))b_{\eta }(s)\int_{x=0}^{S}q(x,t){dx}+
\label{sigma_Q} \\
&&\eta (t)\int_{x=0}^{S}q(x,t)\int_{y=-\varepsilon }^{x}\sigma
_{h}(y)b_{h}(y,s)dydx-  \notag \\
&&\int_{x=0}^{p}q(x,t)\int_{y=-\varepsilon }^{x}\sigma _{h}(y)b_{h}(y,s)dydx
\notag
\end{eqnarray}%
\ The joint quadratic variation of $h(x,.)$ and $h(y,.)$ is:%
\begin{equation}
A_{h}(x,y,t)=\rho _{h}(x,y)t  \label{Ah}
\end{equation}

\subsection{Verification of Assumption \protect\ref{ass::iwk_condition_Q}}

Continuity of $Q$ in the argument $p$ is obvious, thus assumption IWK\ (ii)
is verified.

\subsubsection{Verification of IWK iii.a)}

\label{sec::verify_continuity_Q}

The process $f(p,t)$ is differentiable in $p$. Inspection of (\ref{mu_Q})
shows that $\mu _{Q}$ is continuous in $p$. The volatility $\Sigma (p,s,t)$
in (\ref{sigma_Q}) is clearly a continuous function of $p$, and so is $%
\sigma _{Q}(p,t)$.

\subsubsection{Verification of IWK iii.b)}

Continuity of terms (1)\ and (2) is obvious. From (\ref{sigma_Q}), we
calculate
\begin{equation}
\frac{\partial \Sigma (p,s,t)}{\partial p}=-q{(p,t)}\int_{y=-\varepsilon
}^{p}\sigma _{h}(y)b_{h}(y,s)dy  \label{dsigmadp_thefirst}
\end{equation}

which is clearly a continuous function of $p$, thus proving continuity of
term (3). Continuity of terms (4) and (5) follows trivially.

\subsubsection{Verification of IWK iv and v}

Clearly ${\int_{y=-\varepsilon }^{p}h(y,t)dy}$ is normal, thus $q(p,t)$ is
lognormal, and has thus finite moments. For simplicity, we drop the argument
$t$. By Lemma \ref{lemma::finite_eighth_moment}, we can break the argument
into verifying finiteness of the 16th moments of the following random
variables:

\begin{enumerate}
\item \textbf{Net demand\ }$Q(p).$ By Jensen's inequality:%
\begin{equation*}
\mathbb{E}[(\int_{0}^{S}q(x)dx)^{16}]\leq S^{15}\int_{s=0}^{S}\mathbb{E}%
\left[\exp (16\int_{y=-\epsilon }^{x}h(y)dy)\right]ds
\end{equation*}%
which is bounded. By (\ref{eqn_Q})
\begin{equation*}
-\int_{x=0}^{S}q(x)dx\leq Q(p)\leq \int_{x=0}^{S}q(x)dx
\end{equation*}

Thus $E[Q(p)^{16}]$ is bounded.

\item \textbf{Volatility of net demand }$\sigma _{Q}$. Observe that $\sigma
_{h}(x),g\left( \eta \right) $ and $\eta $ are bounded. Since $%
q(x,t)\int\limits_{y=-\varepsilon }^{x}\sigma _{h}(y)b_{h}(y,s)dy$ is
lognormal, it has finite moments. We apply Cauchy inequality to (\ref%
{sigma_Q}) to show that $E[\Sigma (p,s)^{16}]$ is bounded. By Jensen's
inequality,%
\begin{equation*}
\mathbb{E}[\sigma _{Q}(p)^{16}]\leq S^{15}\int\limits_{s=0}^{S}\mathbb{E}%
\left[\Sigma (p,s)^{16}\right]ds
\end{equation*}

\item \textbf{Drift of net demand }$\mu _{Q}$. Let $H(x)=\int_{y=-%
\varepsilon }^{x}h(y)dy$. By the Jensen and Cauchy-Schwartz inequalities:%
\begin{eqnarray*}
\mathbb{E}\left[\left(\int_{x=0}^{S}\exp (H(x))H(x)dx\right)^{16}\right]
&\leq &S^{15}\mathbb{E}\left[\int_{x=0}^{S}\exp (16H(x))H(x)^{16}dx\right] \\
&\leq &S^{15}\left(\int_{x=0}^{S}\mathbb{E}\left[\exp (32H(x))\right]%
dx\int_{x=0}^{S}\mathbb{E}[H(x)^{32}]dx\right)^{1/2}
\end{eqnarray*}

which is bounded. Since $a(y),\bar{h}(y)$ and $\int\limits_{y=-\varepsilon
}^{x}\int\limits_{y^{\prime }=-\varepsilon }^{x}\frac{Cov[dh(y,t),dh(y^{%
\prime }(t)]}{2dt}dydy^{\prime }$ are bounded, then $\mathbb{E}[f(S)^{16}]$
is bounded. Applying Cauchy's inequality to (\ref{mu_Q}), and noticing that $%
a_{\eta },\bar{\eta},\eta $,$g(\eta )$ and $\sigma _{h}(y)$ are bounded, we
conclude that $E[\mu _{Q}(p)^{16}]$ is bounded.

\item \textbf{Price drift }$\mu _{P}$. We refer the reader to (\ref{mu_Px})
in the main text. Since the numerator has finite 16th moment, it is
sufficient, by the Cauchy-Schwartz inequality, to prove boundedness of:%
\begin{equation*}
\mathbb{E}\left[(\frac{1}{\partial Q/\partial p})^{16}\right]=\mathbb{E}%
\left[\exp \left( -16{\int_{x=-\varepsilon }^{p}h(x,t)dx}\right) \right]
\end{equation*}%
\qquad which is clear.

\item \textbf{Price volatility }$\sigma _{P}$. We use the same argument as
above, since%
\begin{equation*}
\sigma _{P}=\frac{\sigma _{Q}}{\partial Q/\partial p}
\end{equation*}

\item \textbf{First derivative of net demand} $\frac{\partial Q(p)}{\partial
p}$. Finiteness of the moment is clear, since the random variable in (\ref%
{dQdp_3}) is lognormal.

\item \textbf{Second Derivative of Net Demand}$\frac{\partial Q^{2}(p)}{%
\partial p^{2}}$. Applying the Cauchy-Schwartz inequality on (\ref{dQdp_2_3}%
), we see that this has finite 16th moment.

\item \textbf{Derivative of Net Demand Volatility }$\frac{\partial \Sigma
(p,s)}{\partial p}$. We reuse (\ref{dsigmadp_thefirst}), and use the same
logic as above.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Verification of Assumption~\protect\ref{ass::iwk_condition_P}}

Since $Q(.,t)$ is bijective and continuous, so is its inverse $P(.,t)$. Thus
IWK (ii) is verified. We rewrite (\ref{dQdp_3}) as:

\begin{equation*}
\frac{\partial Q(P(x,t),t)}{\partial p}=-\exp \left( {\int_{y=-\varepsilon
}^{P(x,t)}h(y,t)dy}\right)
\end{equation*}

Thus:%
\begin{eqnarray}
\frac{\partial P(x,t)}{\partial x} &=&-\exp \left( {\int_{y=-\varepsilon
}^{-P(x,t)}h(y,t)dy}\right)  \label{dPdx} \\
\frac{\partial ^{2}P(x,t)}{\partial x^{2}} &=&\frac{\partial P(x,t)}{%
\partial x}{\int_{y=-\varepsilon }^{-\partial P(x,t)/\partial x}h(y,t)dy}
\label{dPdx_square}
\end{eqnarray}

\subsubsection{Verification of IWK iii.a)}

Immediate from (\ref{mu_Px}),(\ref{sigma_P})\ and (\ref{b_P}). Continuity of
the characteristics of $Q$ was proved under \ref{sec::verify_continuity_Q}.
The result follows from the continuity of $P$ as a function of $x$.

\bigskip

\subsubsection{Verification of IWK iii.b)}

Continuity of terms (1)\ and (2) follows from (\ref{dPdx}) and (\ref%
{dPdx_square}). From (\ref{sigma_P}), we calculate
\begin{equation}
\frac{\partial \lbrack \sigma _{P}(x,t)b_{P}(x,s,t)]}{\partial x}=-\frac{%
\partial }{\partial x}\left( \frac{\Sigma (x,s,t)}{\frac{\partial Q}{%
\partial p}(P(x,t),t)}\right)   \label{dsigmadp}
\end{equation}

and continuity of term (3) follows from the differentiability of $P$ (see (%
\ref{dsigmadp_thefirst}) and (\ref{dPdx})).

\subsubsection{Verification of IWK iv and v}

For simplicity, we drop the argument $t$. By Lemma~\ref%
{lemma::finite_eighth_moment}, we can break the argument into verifying
finiteness of the 16th moments of the following random variables:

\bigskip

\begin{enumerate}
\item \textbf{Price }$P(x)$. By definition it is bounded.

\item \textbf{Volatility of price }$\sigma _{P}$. Obvious from the proof of
Assumption~\ref{ass::iwk_condition_Q}.

\item \textbf{Price drift }$\mu _{P}$. Obvious from the proof of Assumption~%
\ref{ass::iwk_condition_Q}.

\item \textbf{Strategy drift }$\mu _{\theta }$.By Assumption~\ref%
{ass::theta_semimartingale}.

\item \textbf{Strategy volatility }$\sigma _{\theta }$. By Assumption~\ref%
{ass::theta_semimartingale}.

\item \textbf{First derivative of price} $\frac{\partial P}{\partial x}$.
From (\ref{dPdx}).

\item \textbf{Second derivative of price}$\frac{\partial ^{2}P}{\partial
x^{2}}$. From (\ref{dPdx_square}).

\item \textbf{Derivative of Price Volatility }$\frac{\partial \lbrack \sigma
_{P}(x,t)b_{P}(x,s,t)]}{\partial x}$. From (\ref{dsigmadp}) and the fact
that $\frac{\partial \lbrack \Sigma (x,s,t)]}{\partial x}$ has finite 8th
moment (see above).
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Verification of Assumption~\protect\ref%
{ass::novikov_condition_lambda} and Equation (\protect\ref{MPR})}

By (\ref{rho_h}),(\ref{Ah}), as well as our assumptions on $b_{h}$ and $\rho
_{h}$, the joint quadratic variation $A_{h}(x,y,t)$ satisfies the assumption
of theorem 3.1.2. in Kunita with $m=2$. Thus $h(p,t)$ has a
modification which is twice differentiable in $p$.

The term $\frac{\partial ^{2}Q}{\partial p^{2}}$ is twice differentiable in $%
p$ since $h(p,t)$ is. A similar line of proof allows us to conclude that $%
\mu _{Q}(p,t)$ and $C(p,t)$ are also twice differentiable in $p$. Thus $%
B(p,t)$ defined in(\ref{DefofB}) is also twice differentiable in $p$. We
omit the parameter $t$. We now differentiate (\ref{MPR}) w.r.t. $p$ to
obtain:%
\begin{equation}
-\int_{s=0}^{S}q{(p)\int_{y=-\varepsilon }^{p}}\sigma
_{h}(y)b_{h}(y,s)dy\lambda (s)ds=\frac{\partial B(p)}{\partial p}\text{ }
\label{dBdp}
\end{equation}

Since ${q(p)}$ is different from zero with probability one, we can divide by
$q{(p)}$ and differentiate a second time to obtain, for $p\in \lbrack 0,S]$:%
\begin{equation}
-\int_{s=\delta _{1}}^{S}\sigma _{h}(p)b_{h}(p,s)\lambda (s)ds=\frac{\frac{%
\partial ^{2}B(p)}{\partial p^{2}}q(p)-\frac{\partial B(p)}{\partial p}\frac{%
\partial ^{2}Q(p)}{\partial p^{2}}}{q(p)^{2}}  \label{tobeinverted}
\end{equation}

Since $\sigma _{h}(p)$ is assumed bounded away from zero, we can divide by $%
\sigma _{h}(p)$. Observe that the right-hand side is a.s. bounded. By the
assumption that $B_{h}$ has full rank, $\lambda (s)$ is determined by (\ref%
{tobeinverted}) for $s\in \lbrack \delta _{1},S]$, and is a.s. bounded. We
can then evaluate (\ref{dBdp}) at $p=0$. This gives:%
\begin{equation*}
\int_{s=\delta _{0}}^{\delta _{1}}q{(0)\int_{y=-\varepsilon }^{0}}\sigma
_{h}(0)b_{h}(0,s)dy\lambda (s)ds=\frac{\partial B(p)}{\partial p}%
|_{p=0}-\int_{s=\delta _{1}}^{S}q{(0)\int_{y=-\varepsilon }^{0}}\sigma
_{h}(0)b_{h}(0,s)dy\lambda (s)ds
\end{equation*}

Since the right handside is a.s. bounded, it is possible to specify $\lambda
(s)$ for $s\in \lbrack \delta _{0},\delta _{1}).$We can then specify $%
\lambda (s)$ for $s\in \lbrack 0,\delta _{0})$ by solving the single
equation:

\begin{equation}
\int_{s=0}^{\delta _{0}}\Sigma (0,s)\lambda (s)ds=B(0)-\int_{s=\delta
_{0}}^{S}\Sigma (0,s)\lambda (s)ds  \label{this}
\end{equation}

Agsin, since the right-hand side is a.s bounded, it is possible to find a
solution $\lambda (s)$ to (\ref{this}) for $s\in \lbrack 0,\delta _{0})$
which is a.s. bounded. By Theorem 7.19 in \cite{Kun97}, Novikov's criterion
holds.
